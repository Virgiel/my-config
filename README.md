## Why use Javascript for scripting

### Bash

Good default for unix system but not really cross platform (WSL do not count).
And by the way WTF is this syntax, I am suppose to learn yet another language
for the sole purpose of writing scripts ?

### Python

Do not really like the syntax. Need to install modules with pip and this get
complicated for nothing in NixOs.

### Javascript

To be honest this if not at all my favorite language. However, I already use
this language in web development, it is cross platform and, with the Deno
runtime, dependencies are juste url that self downloads themselves. It is also
straight forward to use in NisOs `nix-shell -p deno`.
