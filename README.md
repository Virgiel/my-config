## Why use Javascript for scripting

### Bash

Good default for unix system but not really cross platform (WSL do not count). And by the way WTF is this syntax, I am suppose to learn yet another language forthe sole purprose of writing scripts ?

### Python

Do not really like the syntax. Need to install modules with pip and this get complicated for nothing in NixOs.

### Javascript

To be honest this if not at all my favorite language. However, I allready use this language in web devloppment, it is cross platform and, with the Deno runtime, dependencies are juste url that seld downloads themseleves. It is also straigth forweard to use in NisOs `nix-shell -p deno --pure`.
